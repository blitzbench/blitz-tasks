/**
 * @struct Timings
 * @brief Per-phase timing of a single runner invocation.
 *
 * Verbatim port of the example_compute_kernel_vendor_specific Timings struct
 * into namespace `bench`. All durations are seconds expressed as double —
 * std::chrono::duration<double> is std::chrono::duration<double, std::ratio<1>>.
 * Convert to milliseconds at the print site with `.count() * 1000.0`.
 *
 * Where the backend exposes device-side profiling events (OpenCL events,
 * CUDA / HIP events, Vulkan timestamp queries, Level Zero kernel-timestamp
 * events, Metal MTLCommandBuffer GPU{Start,End}Time), kernel_compute and the
 * device-side copies are measured by the device clock. Where the upload /
 * download is a host memcpy into shared / mapped memory (Vulkan host-coherent,
 * Metal shared, Level Zero shared USM), the copy duration is host wall-time
 * around the memcpy.
 *
 * total brackets the full upload → launch → download → sync sequence on the
 * host clock, excluding context / queue / module / kernel creation and final
 * teardown.
